# Jefimenko Field Plotter

## Overview

The Jefimenko Field Plotter is a Python program designed to visualize the electric fields of moving charges based on Jefimenko's equations. These equations describe the electric and magnetic fields due to a distribution of moving electric charges and are integral in understanding the effects of special relativity on moving charges.

## Features

- Computes and visualizes the electric field of a moving charge.
- Incorporates effects of both the velocity and acceleration of the charge.
- Uses well-established scientific libraries like SciPy and NumPy for accurate computations.
- Plots showing variations of electric field with respect to distance.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd [project-directory]
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python jefimenko_field_plotter.py
```

After running the script, you should see a plot depicting the variations of the electric field due to position, motion (velocity), and acceleration of the charge.

## Understanding the Plot

- `E`: Represents the electric field due to a stationary charge.
- `F`: Visualizes the electric field contribution due to the velocity of the charge, incorporating relativistic effects.
- `G`: Incorporates the effects of both the charge's velocity and acceleration.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporation of Jefimenko's magnetic field component for a holistic representation.
- Integration over a distribution of charges to account for multiple sources.
- Additional refinements based on user feedback and further research.
